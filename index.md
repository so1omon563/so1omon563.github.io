# I live here

Here you can find links to some of my personal and professional work.

I make music as [The Bittersweet Way](https://thebittersweetway.com). We're very good.

I write a TON of Terraform stuff in my spare time and for my job.

You can find my public Terraform modules in the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/namespaces/so1omon563).

I also dabble in other code, which you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/so1omon563).
